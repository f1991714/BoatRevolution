# BoatRevolution
A series boat telling industrial revolution  

There are several versions of the boat. They required different materials.

Mould is necessary for all boats. 
There are 2 files in the /Mould folder. 

"Mould.stl" is for 3D printing.
The printing setting should be at least 20% fill. Cause we need to use vacumn machine to make the shell, ABS will be better than PLA material.

"Structure.dxf" is for the inner structure which need to laser cut with 3mm materials, wood material will be a better choice but Not include MDF.
