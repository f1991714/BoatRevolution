When I was major in Machenical Engineering, I learn a pop-pop boat lesson in my freshman year which is almost 10 years ago.

Last year, I start teaching technology in junior high school. I found the pop-pop boat project is a classic lesson to teach students doing sruff but not really easy to help students learn the theory and the backgrounds.

So, I combined the things that I learned from not only ME but also Industrial Design. Trying to make a series of boats that can easily build to demostrate the revolution of the boats.

Hope people can learned the industrial revolution history from this series of boats.

In this project, you may need to use some digital fabricating devices like 3D printer, laser cutting and vacumn machine. You also need to have some ability of simple woodworking, soldering. If you're really high interested in this, some simple coding will make this project more fun.

I may need several months to upload all the files I got.
